### <ins>Group 07</ins>

## **Brief Description docs:**  
TeamFormation -   Summarizes the portal’s vision, scope, and goals. The myMMU system aims to provide centralized academic and administrative services through CMS and SMS Gateway integration, improving communication for students, parents, lecturers, and admins.  

ContextObjects -   Key context objects: Student, Parent, Lecturer, Admin, CMS, SMS Gateway, Grades, Billing, Attendance. Each plays a role in data flow and requirement sourcing.  

ElicitationPlan -  Five techniques used: brainstorming, interview, questionnaire, prototyping, and Perspective-Based Reading. The Kano Model guides prioritization of features.  

ElicitationExecution -   Outlines how each elicitation technique was carried out: brainstorming, interviews, questionnaires, prototyping, and PBR. Includes key findings and how they informed the system’s requirements.  

SRS -   A formal software requirements document structured under ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018. Includes system overview, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, diagrams, data structures, validation methods, and compliance references.  

## **Team members:**  
1. Yang Jia En -   Team Leader  
2. Teoh Xuan Xuan -   Documentation, analysis  
3. Tey Jun Cheng - Diagrams

**Noted:**  
We would like to highlight some unforeseen challenges that affected our group’s task distribution:

1. Tey Jun Cheng contributed fully to drawing diagrams. However, due to recurring medical leave (MC), the rest of the team mutually agreed to take over his remaining responsibilities.  

2. Yang Jia En experienced a major technical issue—her laptop’s motherboard was damaged. As a result, she was unable to commit her task to gitHub.

We appreciate your understanding regarding these unexpected circumstances that occurred during the course of the assignment.
